# Personal portfolio

**Live site:** https://avneetgrewal114.com

## what is this?
A globe-based interactive portfolio that tells the story of my life through five chapters across five continents. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks.

## how it works
- Interactive 3D globe (Globe.gl) with clickable pins at five locations
- Each pin opens a chapter of my life with a personal story + work experience timeline
- Scroll-based intro animation with scattered text and photos
- Designed to make visitors feel something, not just read a resume

## chapters
| Chapter | Location | Years |
|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Punjab, India | 2005 – ∞ |
| 2 | Cape Town, South Africa | 2023 |
| 3 | Bethlehem, PA — Lehigh University | 2024 – 2028 |
| 4 | London & Scotland, UK | 2024 |
